This repository contain the contents of some MKS CDs for their RGAs.

If you are looking for an older version of the software, check
https://github.com/HenryFBP/easyview-MKS-RGA-mass-spectrometer-archive.

### CD 1

The first CD includes the program files, which can be used to install Process Eye
or Easyview.

There are many install codes, which you can check by diassembling
`adminSetup.exe`, but what most people will want to use is `diamond` for Process
Eye Professional, and `easyview` for just Easyview.


### CD 2

The second CD includes the manuals.
